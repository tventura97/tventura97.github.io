I knew at that moment that my passion was technology. I started building my own computers, then building them for my friends, then finding any excuse to build them in general. But, I wasn\u2019t satisfied with just building computers. I wanted to take my desire to create things and apply it on a wider spectrum. So, going into college, I decided to major in electrical and computer engineering. I knew that it would give me the skills that I needed to be able to pursue my interests as a career.

We pitched the idea at competitions and PLACES, raising over $10,000 in funding, and even got invited to present our work at the Clinton Global Initiative - University (CGI-U) annual conference. RFInD was very technically challenging. It wasn\u2019t easy (or cheap) to come up with an implementation of the idea that was both economical and effective. But, I was passionate about the idea.

However, since I was the only intern who had some form of programming experience, they reassigned me to a different project - developing a mobile application that would assist students in learning physics. I had taken classes in C++ for my major, but I never learned anything about developing mobile apps. I ended up learning the fundamentals of app development and even some game design basics. I worked closely with the physics professors that would be adopting my application and used Unity to create a mobile application that provided a more interactive learning experience.

It sounded simple enough. But as my work progressed, I found myself taking charge of a lot more things.

It was capable of testing a bottle, producing thousands of data points, and analyzing that data to provide the user with information about the performance of different sensors. After the equipment was operating reliably, I was then tasked with improving one of the sensors in the bottle. I wasn\u2019t exposed to anything related to electromagnetic sensor design in school, so this was an entirely new realm for me. I learned everything I could about electromagnetic sensor design and its use in the industry, and applied that knowledge in my internship. I created several different sensor patterns and, using the equipment I built earlier, acquired and analyzed thousands of data points to determine which patterns had the best performance.
